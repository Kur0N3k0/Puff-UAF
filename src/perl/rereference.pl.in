# this script rereferences the time variable in NCEP reanalysis data to 
# smaller values that work with in Puff.  Normally, the values
# have units of "hours since 1-1-1".  This script makes them smaller by 
# referencing them to Jan 1 of the year the data is valid. For example, the
# file uwnd.1999.nc would have the time variable as 'hours since 1-1-1999"
#
# The NCO operators are required to use this scripts, get them from 
# nco.sourceforge.net
#
# There are a few checks before the file is overwritten, but you might want to
# make a copy of the first file you process in case something goes awry.
# USAGE:
# reference.pl <file>
