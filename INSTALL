--- Puff UAF ---
These are the installation notes for the UAF version of Puff:
./configure; make; make check; make install

see ./configure --help for options and useful envirnment variables.

if 'make check' gives errors, see the testXX.log for details in the test/ directory.  If the problem persists, send it to the current maintainer rorik@puff.images.alaska.edu.

Documentation is in texinfo format and not created by default since different systems will have different documentation processors.  To create documentation in a specific format, go into the doc/ directory and type 'make puff.html', 'make puff.ps', 'make puff.pdf', etc. depending on the desired format.

You need the conformal mapping functions from http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ss/models/cmapf.html.  However, I've included version 2.0 with this distribution, and should build automatically if you don't have them. 

I have not been able to resolve the fact that libnetcdf_c++ and puff must BOTH be compiled with the same version of g++.  I think the problem is due to the changes in name mangling between pre/post version 3 of gcc.  I don't know if this is my problem or theirs, but until I figure it out, use the same compiler :( I have found that version 3.5.0 of netcdf compiles better with gcc-2.95, and version 3.5.1 works better with versions of gcc >= 3.0, i.e. gcc-3.3.  You can use the environment variable NETCDF_INC and NETCDF_LIB to specify the location of netcdf stuff, see './configure --help'.  

If you run into symbol referencing errors with UDUNITS library (i.e. utInit() ), it might be because the header file 'udunits.h' does not declare the function external.  In which case, you must add the following near the top of udunits.h:


#if defined(__cplusplus)
extern "C" {
#endif

and then again at the bottom:
#if defined(__cplusplus)
}
#endif

Again, I don't know if this is their problem or mine, but this seems to work.  


Have fun, and let me know what you think.
