1.allowing -sorted option to have multiple values, i.e. -sorted=lon,no so sorted is done only once by longitude.
2. allow Stokes settling to be dependent on altitude, maybe by air density.
3. fix sorting routine, some particles are outlyers.  
puff -saveAshInit true ... ; ashdump file -z > ash.dat ; octave ; load ash.dat; plot(ash)
4. add puff history to PNG and GIF's, probably use 'convert -comment "string" '
5. Make puff 'history' attribute additive for multiple eruptions that use -restartFile=ashfile, so simulations can be reproduced.
