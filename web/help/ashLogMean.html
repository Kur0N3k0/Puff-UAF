<h1>log mean size[m]</h1>
Use this to specify a normal (or Gaussian) distribution of the particle size.  Specify both the log of the mean particle radius in meters, and the width of the standard deviation in the distribution.  For example, in the figure shown below, the mean particle radius is <b>-6</b>, or 1 micron, and the standard deviation is <b>1</b>&sigma;, which means that 68% (by number, not mass) of that particles will be between 0.1 and 10 microns.<p>
This option is exclusive of specifying a <a href="phiDist.html">&phi; distribution</a>.
