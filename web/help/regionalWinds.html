<h1>Local Windfields [deg]</h1>
Extract a local windfield from a global dataset.  The region spans from -<i>N</i> to +<i>N</i> degrees around the volcano in both the N-S and E-W direction.  This option speeds up run time dramatically by only processing s small fraction of the windfield data.  When winds are strong, or run times long, you may need to increase this value.  It becomes apparent when ash seems to disappear some distance away.
