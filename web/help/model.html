<h1>Wind Models</h1>
There are several different wind models to choose from:
<ul>
 <li><b><font color="red">avn</font></b> - Global prediction model on a 1.25&deg; x 1.25&deg; grid, 1000 to 70 millibars.  Forecast data is every six hours to 48 hours, then 60 and 72 hours.</li>
<li><b><font color="red">badc</font></b> - Global data set on a 2.5&deg; x 2.5&deg; grid, 1000 to 0.316 millibars, every 12 hours.  Archive data is available back to 1990, although all may not be available on this server at this time.</li>
<li><b><font color="red">nogaps</font></b> - Global data on a 1.0&deg; x 1.0&deg; grid, 27 levels from 1013 to 10 millibars.  Forecast data is every 6 hours out to 144 hours.  Nogaps is the highest resolution global data set, so simulations may take quite a while (> 5 min).</li>
<li><b><font color="red">reanalysis</font></b> - Global data on a 2.5&deg; x 2.5&deg; grid, 1000 to 10 millibars, every 6 hours.  Archive data is available back to ~1950, although all may not be available on this server at this time.</li>
<li><b><font color="red">WRF</font></b> - Polar sterographic projection centered on Alaska with a 10 km x 10 km grid, 9 levels from 1000 to 200 millibars.  Forecast data is every 3 hours out to 48 hours.  Some Outter Aleutian volcanos are not included within this grid.</li>
</ul>
