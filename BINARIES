Instructions for building binaries of Puff

Although GMT and ImageMagick convert are required, they should be installed by the user using their package manager if possible.  GMT is simply too large.

* Build and install libnetcdf in PREFIX
* Build and install udunits
* Build and install decoders in PREFIX
	./configure CC=gcc --prefix=PREFIX
* Build and install NCO in PREFIX
* Build and install (un)gifsicle in PREFIX
	configure --enable-ungif --prefix=PREFIX
* configure, make, and make install puff in PREFIX
* Check/modify paths in ashgmt
* set $home and $ENV{UDUNITS_PATH} variables in Webpuff.pm
* refresh copy of etc/puffrc
* add udunits.dat to etc/
* make data directory (and populate?)
* tar and gzip.


Users need to make the following changes
Webpuff.pm: $home, and probably $ENV{UDUNITS_PATH}
ashgmt: executable locations for GMT and probably the others
puffrc: set paths to data directories
setenv UDUNITS_PATH to use command-line puff
populate data directories
